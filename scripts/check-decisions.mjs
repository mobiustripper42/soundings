// Two parsers, on purpose. Legacy records keep going through `parseFrontmatter`, which is a
// hand-rolled reader for one flat block. Records carrying `schema: 1` go through js-yaml,
// because their frontmatter has nested lists of objects and a hand-rolled reader is how the
// original record ended up with `dumb:` and `boat:` as keys — a colon in prose parsing as a
// mapping and nobody noticing.
//
// The gate is the `schema: 1` key itself. A record without it is grandfathered and skipped.
// In jig that path should stay dead: the corpus started empty on 2026-08-27 and every record
// here is v1, so a record without the key is a mistake rather than history.
//
// THE COMMENT THAT USED TO BE HERE IS THE REASON THIS ONE IS. It declared a one-line blocker
// — `LISTS` knowing only `amends_spec`, so a `claims:` list threw and broke every downstream
// check — and closed with "convert nothing until the generator's parser is widened." The
// generator was widened in the very next commit; `LISTS` has held `claims` and `supersedes`
// since. The instruction outlived its condition by weeks and was still being obeyed when jig
// read it, because nothing retires a comment. This is the corpus-rot argument arriving one
// level down, and the reason `revisit_if` is required in jig's schema and optional in
// muster's: prose about the state of the code cannot be trusted to notice it changed.
//
// Claim TARGETS are deliberately not resolved. `kind` is checked against the enum and the
// shape is checked; whether `src/foo.ts` exists is a resolver's job, and resolvers get built
// once the rewritten records show which kinds actually appear.
